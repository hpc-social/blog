<p><strong>How to participate</strong></p>




<p>Whether you’re at one of the 51 institutions that contributed in the previous two years, or interested in participating for the first time,<strong>&nbsp;there’s still plenty of time</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMsGsXV9_2gom4ojVua7W7k98kBsZh_SyH3cGm46XeozJuQg/viewform">request your copy of the assessment tool</a>, complete the assessment, and&nbsp;<a href="https://carcc.org/rcdcm/submit">submit it</a> before the December 15 deadline.</p>




<p><strong>Why participate?&nbsp;</strong></p>




<p>The RCD Capabilities Model allows participating institutions to:&nbsp;</p>




<ul><li>Assess their support for computationally- and data-intensive research.</li><li>Identify potential areas for improvement.&nbsp;</li><li>Understand how the broader community views Research Computing and Data support.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Contributing institutions help build the Community Dataset, and enrich the&nbsp;<a href="https://carcc.org/2022/05/25/2021-rcd-capabilities-model-community-data-report-now-available/">resulting picture we have of our community</a>. You will also get an&nbsp;<strong>individualized benchmarking report</strong>&nbsp;that compares your assessment to the community at-large, as well as segments of the community (R1s, R2s, Public or Private institutions, etc.). And for those who really like digging into data, you get access to the anonymized, aggregated dataset.</p>




<p><strong>Have questions or need help?</strong></p>




<p>You can get help, including advice on how to approach your assessment, understanding the questions, and interpreting the results by emailing&nbsp;<a href="mailto:capsmodel-help@carcc.org">capsmodel-help@carcc.org</a>, or joining our&nbsp;<a href="https://carcc.org/2022/06/17/2022-rcd-capabilities-model-office-hours/">RCD CM Office Hours</a>&nbsp;on the second Tuesday of each month at 1pm ET. You can also subscribe to the&nbsp;<a href="mailto:capsmodel-discuss@carcc.org">capsmodel-discuss@carcc.org</a>&nbsp;discussion list (<a href="mailto:capsmodel-discuss-subscribe@googlegroups.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE">click here to join</a>), to hear how other institutions are completing their assessment and using it as part of strategic planning.&nbsp;</p>
