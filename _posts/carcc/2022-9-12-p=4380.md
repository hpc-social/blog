title: Who We (RCD Professionals) Are
---

<p>Thanks to the 563 RCD professionals who took the <a href="https://carcc.org/rcd-professionalization/rcdprof-census/">2021 Workforce Survey</a>, we have a better understanding of who we are as a community.</p>




<p>The first results from the survey were presented at PEARC22 &#8211; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3491418.3530289">Characterizing the US Research Computing and Data (RCD) Workforce</a> &#8211; and the data is available on <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6574465">Zenodo</a>.  While you can make your own data visualizations, there are now also visualizations of the results available on the <a href="https://rcd-nexus.org/data/rcd-workforce-data/">RCD Nexus site</a> that you&#8217;re welcome to use.</p>




<p>Here&#8217;s a preview:</p>
