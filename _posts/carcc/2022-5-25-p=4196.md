title: 2021 RCD Capabilities Model Community Data report now available
---

<p>The second <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/6502962#.Yoe-Ky1h2_w">Research Computing and Data (RCD) Capabilities Model Community Dataset report</a> is now available through <a href="http://rcd-nexus.org/">CaRCC’s RCD Nexus</a> as part of a project funded by the National Science Foundation. The report aggregates assessments contributed by 51 higher education institutions, providing insight into the current state of support for RCD.</p>




<p>Report data is intended to support strategic planning and decision-making for campus leadership, funding agencies, RCD leaders, and others interested in advanced technologies that enable research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Themes that emerged from the 2021 data include:</p>




<ul>
<li>There is generally stronger support for Researcher-Facing, System-Facing, and Strategy and Policy-Facing areas, than for Data-Facing and Software-Facing capabilities.</li>



<li>R1 institutions have much higher levels of coverage than other Carnegie Classifications, particularly in certain areas.</li>



<li>EPSCoR institutions have significant gaps in capabilities coverage relative to institutions in other states, including dramatic gaps in certain areas of Data-Facing support.</li>
</ul>



<p>“This level of data has never before been readily available to the RCD community,” said Patrick Schmitz, co-principal investigator on the RCD Nexus project. “We were intrigued to see that institutions who completed a second assessment in 2021 saw a marked increase in their capabilities related to RCD strategy and policy. It’s possible the assessment is already helping them improve their programs. We will work to continue expanding the dataset in the coming years, and are pleased to offer the RCD community a solid baseline dataset to help inform strategic planning.”</p>
