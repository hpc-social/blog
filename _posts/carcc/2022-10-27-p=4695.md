<h2>CaRCC People Network Calls</h2>



<h3><a href="https://carcc.org/people-network/data-facing-track/"><strong>Data-Facing Track</strong></a><strong> </strong>(1<sup>st</sup> Tuesdays)</h3>



<p><strong>The ICPSR Research Data Ecosystem</strong>, Jeannette Jackson, University of Michigan ICPSR<br /><em>Tue, Nov 1, 1p ET/ 12p CT/ 11a MT/ 10a PT</em></p>




<p>The Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) is an international consortium of more than 750 academic institutions and research organizations. The ICPSR provides leadership and training in data access, curation, and methods of analysis for the social science research community and is building the Research Data Ecosystem (RDE) funded by the National Science Foundation. The RDE will make research data accessible to broaden participation in the frontiers of scientific research. It will accomplish this goal by modernizing the existing software platform so that it supports the entire research lifecycle with an enhanced user experience to increase the ability of researchers to safely and securely access, connect, store, and manipulate data. This presentation will present some of the challenges and experience in implementation of the RDE along with details about implementation, access and usage.</p>

<p>Intellectual property and technology transfer are important parts of many universities’ research and development initiatives. The capture of intellectual property helps protect the discoveries as well as provide a mechanism for monetization of the discoveries. With increasing focus on digital processing and research, it is important that research computing professionals understand what is needed for intellectual property capture and how platforms as well as permission settings can impact the ability of researchers seeking to capture intellectual property. This CaRCC Researcher-Facing talk will cover the introduction to intellectual property capture as well as one organization’s example of how captured intellectual property is transferred to external users.</p>
