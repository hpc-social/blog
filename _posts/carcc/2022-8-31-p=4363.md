<h2><em>CaRCC People Network Calls:</em></h2>



<p><a href="https://carcc.org/people-network/data-facing-track/"><strong>Data-Facing Track</strong></a><strong> (first Tuesdays)</strong></p>




<p>Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival: Data Collection, Research and Outreach discussion facilitated by Raba Al-Araji, Senior Epidemiologist at <a href="https://mycares.net/index.jsp">CARES</a><br /><em>Tuesday, September 6, 1p ET/ 12p CT/ 11a MT/ 10a PT</em></p>




<p>Cardiac arrest resuscitation is an important measure of a community’s emergency response readiness. Successful resuscitation requires involvement by a range of individuals including bystanders, emergency medical dispatchers, first responders, paramedics, and hospital providers. The Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) allows communities to benchmark their performance with local, state, or national metrics to better identify opportunities to improve out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) care. By creating an easy-to-use and flexible system to collect OHCA data and forming a community to share best practices, CARES has transformed the way EMS agencies are treating cardiac arrest. In this presentation, we will cover components of the CARES system including, but not limited to, the data collection process, research and data sharing, as well as the different ways that the data is translated for scientific and lay audiences.&nbsp;</p>




<p><a href="https://carcc.org/people-network/researcher-facing-track/"><strong>Researcher-Facing Track</strong></a><strong> (second Thursdays)<br />Supporting researchers with interinstitutional collaboration</strong>, facilitators TBD<br /><em>Thurs, September 8, 2022, 1p ET/ 12p CT/ 11a MT/ 10a PT</em></p>




<span id="more-4363"></span>



<p>Collaboration among researchers at different institutions is essential to conducting large-scale research projects. More and more, Researcher-Facing staff confront unique issues when supporting investigations across multiple organizations.&nbsp; Panelists from the CaRCC community will give short presentations highlighting their experiences in this complex landscape. The presentations will be followed by a facilitated discussion.&nbsp;Topics will include:</p>




<ul><li>How to determine the best tools to use for collaboration</li><li>How to establish and maintain relationships with other institutions</li><li>Pain points and success stories</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://carcc.org/people-network/emerging-centers-track/"><strong>Emerging Centers Track</strong></a><strong> (third Wednesdays)</strong></p>




<p><strong>Metrics for RCD Success</strong>, panel discussion<br /><em>Wednesday, Sept 21 2022, 12p ET/ 11a CT/ 10a MT/ 9a PT/ 7a HT</em></p>




<p>A panel of center leaders will discuss the items they believe are most important to collect and share with stakeholders.&nbsp; University of Buffalo’s XDMOD and Coldfront team member(s) will talk about their design decisions when creating their products – why did they develop the tools, collection and presentation of data, etc.&nbsp; Question:&nbsp; how is data collected for researchers using external/cloud services such as public cloud, PRP, etc?&nbsp;</p>




<p><a href="https://carcc.org/people-network/systems-facing-track/"><strong>Systems-Facing Track</strong></a><strong> (third Thursdays)</strong></p>




<p><strong>Open XDMoD/ColdFront/Open OnDemand HPC Toolset Overview</strong>, discussion facilitated by Andrew Bruno &amp; Dori Sajdak of University of Buffalo<br /><em>Thursday, Sept 15th, 12p ET/ 11a CT/ 10a MT/ 9a PT</em></p>




<p>This presentation will be a condensed version of a tutorial given at recent PEARC conferences focused on the systems side of these tools.&nbsp; This should be a great opportunity for both an overview as well as discussion points relevant to supporting them, for HPC systems-facing professionals.&nbsp; Access additional information here: https://github.com/ubccr/hpc-toolset-tutorial and bring your questions!</p>
