title: Compute Canadian- Building a successful and federated computational research
  enterprise, together
---

<p>Canada is a federated nation, and this is particularly visible in
areas of research funding, where both the federal and provincial
orders of government play a role.  In building a successful digital
research infrastructure to support Canadian science and scholarship,
we must recognize that reality, and rely on the successful examples
of many organizations in Canada and around the world that embrace
such a federated approach.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.dursi.ca/assets/pdfs/ComputeCanadianDiscussionPaper.pdf">this discussion paper</a>,
my colleague Jill Kowalchuck and I lay out what we hope to be the beginnings
of a discussion of what a renewed federation for supporting Canadian 
science with advanced research computing and data could look like.</p>

<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h3>

<p>Computing and data, and the expertise and tools to make use of both, is
now central to all fields of study. Ten years after the creation of
Compute Canada in response to the National Platforms Fund call, and
after the Naylor Report on science funding, it is an apt time for the
Canadian community built around this national research platform to take
stock. Is it doing what we need it to do for Canadian researchers? Is it
working the way we want it to? What should a Canadian computation and
data platform for supporting research look like in the coming years?
This document aims to begin that discussion within the community.</p>

<p>Here we propose seven principles to guide us in this discussion â€” that
our project should serve Canadian research in a researcher-centred,
service-oriented, and truly national way; and that it should operate as
a true federation of equal partners, interoperable but not identical,
collaborative and up-to-date. We suggest in particular that it is vital
that our national platform is adaptive and responsive to researchers,
making choices driven by research needs and not technical choices, and
should make full use of the diversity and specialization that a Canadian
federation and its partners offer.</p>

<p>From those principles, we make evidence-based proposals for a renewed
Canadian organization. Comparisons with successful examples of federated
organizations within Canada and abroad suggest that while the basic
architecture of our federation is sound, important roles and
relationships need to be clarified. While a central office must be
responsible for the processes of defining priorities, strategies, and
standards of interoperability, a successful federation requires those
processes to have buy-in from partners committed to the goals of the
federation. The Board of Directors of the central office in a federation
must have experience and training to handle the delicate task of
governing a central office but being responsible to a national
community. The Members need adequate visibility into the operations of
the central office and the federation as a whole so that they can
support their vital role to the organization. And that engagement needs
to extend to all who are invested in the success of research in Canada:
regional staff and Boards, institutional staff, researchers and funders,
and other organizations that provide digital infrastructure for research
in Canada. This document focusses on Compute Canada in particular, but
the principles and proposals apply to any digital research
infrastructure providers, or the system as a whole.</p>

<p>Success for this document will mean starting conversations, inspiring
other documents and differing points of view, and the emerging of a
consensus within the community of what a renewed national platform for
the next ten years looks like. That does not mean this document is a
straw-man. The authors have played roles in the national platform
starting at its inception, from researcher to consortium and regional
(east and west) staff and management, and within the Compute Canada
central office, and hope that experience plus the benefit of some
distance have produced a coherent and compelling vision of what the
Compute Canada national project could be. But what matters is not this
proposal; it is what the community as a whole decides it wants its
national platform to be.</p>
