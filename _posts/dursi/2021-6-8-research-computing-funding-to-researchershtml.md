title: Research Computing Funding Should Mostly Just Go To Researchers
---

<p>Research computing and data — supporting research efforts with
software, computer and data expertise and resources — is fundamentally
all of a piece.  Today  there’s fewer and fewer hard boundaries
between where the system requirements end and where the software
or data resource requirements begin; and teams supporting researchers
must have expertise across the stack.</p>


<p>This convergence is a huge opportunity for research computing, but
it’s also a challenge for funders.  How to know how much to allocate to software,
and how much to hardware?  Within software, how many resources
should go to new software development or procurement, and how much
to maintenance?  In hardware, what is the right balance between
GPUs and CPUs or FPGAs, and within data, how much should we support
curation efforts vs discovery, or archival vs near-line storage?</p>


<p>Luckily, there is a simple, robust, time-tested mechanism research
computing funders can easily take advantage of, and they should do so.
Funders for research computing and data efforts manage their portfolio
effortlessly — in exactly the same way health funders
know how to balance spending between reagents and lab staff, or the
same way physical science funders know how much to allocate to
trainee salaries vs tabletop equipment.</p>


<p>Most research computing funding should go directly to researchers,
via traditional funding councils, and the researchers should spend
that research computing and data portion of their grants as and where
they see fit.</p>


<p>With research computing and data funding as an integral component
of project funding, the same research review process that adjudicates
the research proposal would weigh in on the computing and data
resources requested to conduct it.  This eliminates nonsensical but
all-too-common situations where a researcher successfully wins computing
cycles for a non-funded project, or gets funding for a postdoc for
a project but doesn’t get enough compute or storage resources for
the trainee to perform the project.  It would also allow the
researcher to adjust how they were using resources mid-stream; if
after initial efforts it turned out that software development effort
to improve the code was a better use of funding than throwing
hardware at the problem, the money could be spent that way, rather
than applying ahead of time for people time and computing resources
separately and hoping that it all works out in the end.</p>

<p>In this model, a researcher would include in their grant proposal
a research computing and data component where necessary.  As with
the purchasing wet lab equipment, animal experiments, or large
physical apparatus — undertakings which are no less technical or
complex than research computing — research grants would include
cost justifications for the proposed research computing services
or equipment, and funding agencies would rate the quality of the
justification and the worthiness of the proposed goals versus the
cost.</p>


<p>A researcher whose proposal was successful would then, as with other
line items, be free to spend that research computing and data
component of their grant where they wish on for software development,
data management and analysis, or access to storage and compute
resources.   Obviously as known entities with existing working
relationships, local research computing centres — now working in a
familiar core facility model — would have a huge advantage.  But
the researcher would not be limited to working with those centres,
nor to working with only one service provider.</p>


<p>This approach will work well for capacity computing, data, and
expertise — those needs where there are many possible service
providers.  And in those areas, having the researcher in control
of what services they can use where will help drive those vendors
to providing the kinds and quality of services that researchers
need.  But not every kind of computing or expertise capability is
available enough for researchers to be able to easily buy needed
quantities of.  Researchers can’t conjure into existence a (say)
quantum computing shared facility one investigator-led grant at a
time.  Those new and emerging capabilities have to be handled
separately, with existing funding councils setting priorities. Once
those new capabilities are operational, they can and should be
sustained with the same core-facility portable-funding model; if
they can’t, maybe they didn’t need to be built.  Other needs like
foundational infrastructures — research and education networks,
advisory bodies — will also need to be handled separately by funders.</p>


<p>But for the bulk of research computing, for capacity support of
research using computing, data and related expertise, there’s no
longer need for endless surveys and consultations and projections
to indirectly inform decision making.  Parallel competitions for
different kinds of support for a research project have long since
stopped making sense.  Internal computing organization debates about
what kinds of services to offer should make way for researchers
allocating the funds themselves.  Let researchers decide what works
best for advancing their research.</p>
