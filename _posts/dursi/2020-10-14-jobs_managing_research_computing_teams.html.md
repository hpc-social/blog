title: Things I Learned from Looking at 500 Research Computing Manager Jobs over 10
  Months
---

<p>I write a weekly <a href="https://newsletter.researchcomputingteams.org">newsletter</a>
for research computing managers, team leads, or those aspiring to
those roles.  One of the things I’ve wanted to emphasize in the
newsletter is that managing research computing teams is a profession
in and of itself, and worth doing well.  Part of that is emphasizing
the existence of career opportunities.</p>

<p>So since the beginning I’ve included job listings and  maintained
a <a href="https://www.researchcomputingteams.org/jobs">job board</a>,
posting about 500 such jobs over the past 10 months and removing
them as they become filled or otherwise unavailable.  My main
criteria for such jobs are whether or not I would describe the work
as principally about managing or leading a research computing team - 
admittedly a fuzzy definition.</p>

<p>Over the course of examining those 500 jobs - and looking through
many many more that never made it to the board - I’ve learned some
things:</p>

<p><strong>There are a lot of jobs out there for people managing research
computing teams</strong>.  I’ve <em>never</em> had any trouble finding some weekly
to put in the job board or with highlights interesting enough to
list at the end of the newsletter.</p>

<p><strong>There are certainly many more I’m missing</strong>.  As the field matures
there are starting to be <a href="https://us-rse.org/jobs/">job</a>
<a href="https://society-rse.org/careers/vacancies/">boards</a> for research
software development or for particular sub-fields of research
computing like
<a href="https://bioinformatics.ca/job-postings/#/?&amp;order=desc">bioinformatics</a>.
But, consistent with research’s neglect of management as something
that needs to be done and done well, no such resources exist for
the managers of those important roles. So I have a go-to list of
google and other searches for jobs which I go through a couple of
times a week.</p>

<p>In research, when you’re doing a literature search and you start
hitting the same papers again and again, you’re pretty sure you’ve
got a mostly complete list of references as a starting point.  I’m
nowhere near that with my managing research computing teams job
list, largely because the names we use for these roles vary so
widely.  So I’m confident that I only see a fraction of these jobs.
(You can help out by <a href="https://airtable.com/shrL6QGic3Mv9JFrs">submitting any
jobs</a> you know about).</p>

<p><strong>Research computing teams are broadening, and so is the need for
managers</strong>.  Where this is most obvious is in data science or data
engineering teams, which have spread to every sector and every
industry.  Generic “Manager, Data Science” jobs are so plentiful
that I don’t list most of them - many of them are more operational
rather than “jobs leading research computing teams” - but even the
ones that make the cut are in sectors from health to transportation
to retail to engineering.  There are increasingly data engineering,
cloud architecture, etc roles for supporting research computing
efforts, to say nothing of ML/AI jobs.  And there are countless
management/team lead jobs for specialist research computing in
health, biology, and biomedicine.</p>

<p><strong>Research data management is increasingly employable</strong>.  As the
initial data science and data engineering work in organizations
mature, many institutions are realizing that they now need principled
approaches to data governance, stewardship, and modelling.  This
is happening most rapidly in heavily regulated industries —
health, finance — but is starting to percolate outwards.
Those who have maintained and curated data resources for research,
or who have supported those that do, will be surprised at the number
of jobs in the private sector for doing similar work.</p>

<p><strong>“Traditional” research computing team management jobs remain, and
they take forever to fill</strong>: There are definitely still routinely
“Director of Research Computing, University of Somethingorother”
jobs out there.  And I don’t know whether it’s because of the
pandemic, or because of the competition from other sectors, but
such jobs are taking forever to fill this year.  I routinely see
them open for months, and then reposted one or more times.  I see
this in both for managers of teams running on-premises hardware and
for teams mainly doing software development.</p>

<p><strong>Despite the talk of RSE units, most research computing jobs within
academic institutions are lone outposts</strong>:  While in companies
research computing - data science, computing resource management,
software development - tends to be centralized (even if it is
matrixed out or embedded into other teams), in academia we’re
definitely not there - most of the team leads/manger jobs I see in
Universities are for small teams embedded in a single institute or
project.  I think that’s a shame; it greatly reduces the opportunity
for cross-pollination, learning, and developing best practices,
makes work less efficient and less satisfying, and it makes teams
more management heavy than they need to be.</p>
