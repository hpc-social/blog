title: The Shell For Scientists
---

<p>I’ve posted a half-day “The Shell for Scientists”
<a href="https://github.com/ljdursi/shell-for-scientists">tutorial</a> that
I’ve given variants on a number of times; the motivating problem,
provided by Greg Wilson for a two-day set of of tutorials at the
University of Toronto, was cleaning up a bunch of auditory lab data
on people’s cochlear implants.</p>

<p>The focus is on productivity and automation; PDF slides are available
<a href="https://github.com/ljdursi/shell-for-scientists/raw/master/presentation/presentation.pdf">here</a>
(although I really should translate them into a markdown-based format to
make them more re-usable).</p>

<p>Covered are a number of basic shell commands</p>

<ul>
  <li>echo</li>
  <li>pwd</li>
  <li>cd</li>
  <li>ls</li>
  <li>man</li>
  <li>file</li>
  <li>cat</li>
  <li>more</li>
  <li>wc</li>
  <li>mv</li>
  <li>cp</li>
  <li>rm</li>
  <li>head</li>
  <li>tail</li>
  <li>sort</li>
  <li>mkdir</li>
  <li>rmdir</li>
  <li>grep</li>
  <li>for..do..done</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as simple script writing.  There is some optional material
on make (again, for automation) and ssh/scp (because that was
frequently necessary for tutorials at SciNet).  There are a number
of hands-on exercises sprinkled throughout.</p>
