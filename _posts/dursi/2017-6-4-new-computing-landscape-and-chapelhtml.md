title: Chapel's Home in the Landscape of New Scientific Computing Languages
---

<p>I was invited to speak at this past weekend’s fourth annual Chapel Implementers and Users Workshop (<a href="http://chapel.cray.com/CHIUW2017.html">CHIUW 2017</a>).
It was a great meeting, with lots of extremely high-quality talks on work being done with and on Chapel.  The slides from the presentations
will be up shortly, and I recommend them - the <a href="http://chapel.cray.com/CHIUW/2017/choi-slides.pdf">libfabric</a>, 
<a href="http://chapel.cray.com/CHIUW/2017/kayraklioglu-slides.pdf">KNL</a>, <a href="http://chapel.cray.com/CHIUW/2017/krishna-slides.pdf">use-after-free tracking</a>, and <a href="http://chapel.cray.com/CHIUW/2017/azad-slides.pdf">GraphBLAS</a> works
were of particular interest to me.  The Code Camp on the next day, working with members the Chapel team on individual particular projects, was also a lot of fun.</p>


<p>The topic of my own talk was “Chapel’s Home in the Landscape
of New Scientific Computing Languages (and what it can learn from
the neighbours)”; the materials from the talk can be found
<a href="http://github.com/ljdursi/CHIUW2017">on github</a>.  I described
the sorts of problems I’m particularly interested in, surveyed
some of the languages/frameworks in there, and tried to identify
what I saw as Chapel’s role in the environment.</p>


<p>My slides can be seen below or on <a href="http://ljdursi.github.io/CHIUW2017/#1">github</a>, where <a href="http://github.com/ljdursi/CHIUW2017">the complete materials can be found</a>.</p>
