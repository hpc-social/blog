title: Jupyter Notebooks for Performing and Sharing Bioinformatics Analyses
---

<p>I was asked to do a half-day tutorial at the <a href="https://www.iscb.org/glbioccbc2016-program/workshops">Great Lakes Bioinformatics conference Workshop session</a>.
The focus was mainly on R, with some python as well.  We covered:</p>


<ul>
  <li>The basics of Jupyter notebooks - what they are and how they work</li>
  <li>How to install and run Jupyter notebooks on their laptop, in R and Python</li>
  <li>How to perform interactive analyses in a web browser using Jupyter</li>
  <li>Using markdown and latex to</li>
  <li>How to “Port” an R bioinformatics workflow from some scripts into a Jupyter notebook</li>
  <li>How to share a Jupyter notebook online, using three different approaches
    <ul>
      <li>SageMathCloud</li>
      <li>GitHub and</li>
      <li>mybinder.org</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I think it went prety well; the materials are available <a href="https://github.com/ljdursi/glbio-jupyter-workshop">On GitHub</a>.
It was largely hands-on, so apart from some <a href="https://github.com/ljdursi/glbio-jupyter-workshop/blob/master/Slides/Jupyter.pdf">introductory slides</a>,
it was mainly about giving a tour of the notebook and how use Jupyter to share analyses; the “scripts” that I went through
in presenting the material were aimed at having the students produce the notebooks
